## ⚠ Known Issues/Bugs

- **Overdue Calculation Precision:** The system currently calculates overdue days based only on calendar days, without accounting for weekends or holidays.
- **Duplicate Borrow Sessions:** The system does not limit a member from borrowing the same book multiple times simultaneously. Future improvements may include a check to limit active borrow sessions for each book per member.
